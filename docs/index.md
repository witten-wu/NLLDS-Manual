## Overview

The NLLDS was built for the data collection and organization for Prof. Feng Gangyi's research group.

The NLLDS is used for project management, experiment data collection and storage, and questionnaire management. It can be accessed from the public network.

Here are some quick facts for your reference.

- `Web Address`: http://137.189.158.12/NLLDS/login
- `Administrators`
  - Feng Gangyi, g.feng@cuhk.edu.hk
  - Wu Yidu, yiduwu@cuhk.edu.hk

## Web Interface

In this section, I will introduce some useful features in our website.

### Login

When you access the web address by your browser (recommand chrome, edge, firefox), you will be directed to the login page. Type your username and password (distributed by administrators), and click `Login` button to login.

### Project

If successful you will see the project page. You will see your projects here (Only if the project is managed by you or you are one of the collaborators), you cannot view other projects which are not relevant to you.

The `Add Project` button is only visible to administrators, which means you are not authorized to create projects. When creating a project, administrators need to fill in the project name, project description (not necessary), and assign managers and collaborators.

Here are descriptions of these fields:

- `Project_ID`: Mark the uniqueness of the project. (automatically generated by the system)
- `Project_Name`: Filled by administrators, supports clicking to jump to the subpage.
- `Survey_ID`: Associated with the survey system automatically, supports clicking to jump to the survey page. Will be mentioned again later.
- `Descriptions`: Filled by administrators.
- `Manage_By`: Specified by administrators.
- `Collaborator`: Specified by administrators.
- `Created_By`: Record who created the project.
- `Created_date`: Project create date.

### Subject

If you click the project name or double-click this project item, you will jump to the subpage which lists all the subject information of this project.

Click `Add Subject` button then you can add subjects for this project. You need to specify the `Subject No.` and make sure it matches the naming format in the prompt message. Please note that `Subject No.` does not allow duplicates.

Here are descriptions of these fields:

- `Subject_No`: Specified by you.
- `Survey`: Associated with the survey system automatically, supports clicking to jump to the survey answer page. Will be mentioned again later.
- `TaskFile`: Lists all the tasks of this project and supports clicking to jump to the file system to view this subject's task data. Each task corresponds to a `Behavior` file. Will be mentioned again later.
- `NeuroFile`: Supports clicking to jump to the file system to view this subject's `Neuroimaging` data.

And you can only add tasks for these projects, with support for deletion. After added, you'll see the `TaskFile` synchronization updated in the `Subject` page.

### Survey

Click on the `Survey` navigation in the sidebar, then you will come to the Survey System, which was modified and deployed by the open source project `LimeSurvey`. So you can refer to the official documentation (https://manual.limesurvey.org/LimeSurvey_Manual) for detailed instructions on using this system. You don't need to pay much attention to configuration-related content, as I've already set it up for our usage scenarios, but rather just focus on the questionnaire design and publishing module. Compared to googleform, it supports more comprehensive questionnaire forms and features, and the data can be localized. I will make some special instructions below.
