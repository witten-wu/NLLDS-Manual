Author: Wu Yidu Last updated on Aug 8, 2024 by Yidu Overview The NLLDS was built for the data collection and organization for Prof. Feng Gangyi's research group. The NLLDS is used for project management, experiment data collection and storage, and questionnaire management. It can be accessed from the public network. Here is an overview structure of our system: Here are some quick facts for your reference. Web Address : http://137.189.158.12/NLLDS/login Administrators : Feng Gangyi (g.feng@cuhk.edu.hk) ; Wu Yidu (yiduwu@cuhk.edu.hk) Web Interface In this section, I will introduce some useful features in our website. Login When you access the web address by your browser (recommand chrome, edge, firefox), you will be directed to the login page. Type your username and password (distributed by administrators), and click Login button to login. Project If successful you will see the project page. You will see your projects here (Only if the project is managed by you or you are one of the collaborators), you cannot view other projects which are not relevant to you. The Add Project button is only visible to administrators, which means you are not authorized to create projects. When creating a project, administrators need to fill in the project name, project description (not necessary), and assign managers and collaborators. Here are descriptions of these fields: Project Name : Filled by administrators, supports clicking to jump to the subpage. Survey ID : Associated with the survey system automatically, supports clicking to jump to the survey page. Will be mentioned again later. Manage By : Specified by administrators. Collaborator : Specified by administrators. Created By : Record who created the project. Created date : Project create date. Neuro : Project have neuro test or not. Subject If you click the project name or double-click this project item, you will jump to the subpage which lists all the subject information of this project. The Description here shows the project description you filled before. Click Add Subject button then you can add subjects for this project. The system will automatically generate the latest Subject No. in a specific format. Here are descriptions of these fields: Subject_No : Automatically generated by system. Survey : Associated with the survey system automatically, supports clicking to jump to the survey answer page. Will be mentioned again later. TaskFile : Lists all the tasks of this project and supports clicking to jump to the file system to view/upload this subject's task data. NeuroFile : Supports clicking to jump to the file system to view/upload this subject's Neuroimaging data. Click Add Task button then you can add tasks for this project. You can delete task by right click it. After created, it will show in the TaskFile column and you can click it to view/upload file. Please make sure the file name uploaded same as task name. Here are descriptions of these fields: Task Name : Filled by you. Descriptions : Filled by you. Created By : Record who created the task. Created date : Task create date. Click Check Status button, the system will check the subject's survey answer submitted status and taskfile uploaded status. It will display a green tick when it's status are ready. Survey Click on the Survey navigation in the sidebar, then you will come to the Survey System, which was modified and deployed by the open source project LimeSurvey . So you can refer to the official documentation (https://manual.limesurvey.org/LimeSurvey_Manual) for detailed instructions on using this system. You don't need to pay much attention to configuration-related content, as I've already set it up for our usage scenarios, but rather just focus on the questionnaire design and publishing module. Compared to googleform, it supports more comprehensive questionnaire forms and features, and the data can be localized. I will make some special instructions below. Since the Survey system is independent, you will also need to perform a login operation, with the same account password as you used to log into the NLLDS system. After successful login, you will come to the main interface, which contains navigation of some main functions, focusing on Create survey and List surveys pages. In List surveys page, you can view and manage all surveys here. Remember Survey ID ? We show it on the Project page, and it's the ID that allows the project to be associated with the survey. So how we can associate them? We need to set up the Survey groups same as our project name, and put our project survey into this survey group and active it, and then our system will automatically associate with it. If something wrong, the Survey_ID shows in the Project page will display Not Found . Once everything done, you can find the Survey URL here, also you can click the Survey_ID shows in the Project page, which use the same link. We'd better switch the Survey to closed-access mode, i.e., Survey participants need to get a pre-assigned access code to access the Survey, and we can assign SubjectNo to each participant as their access code. First we need add the participants to the Central participant management . We don't need input too much sensitive information, only last name and email address can help us recognize the specific participant. Then we should assign this participant to the specific survey. After that, we can see them in the survey Next, We need to assign the Subject No. to each participant here. After that, each participant will need to fill in the access code ( Subject No. ) to access their Survey. After the survey participant fills in the correct access code and submits their survey, you can view the survey content of each subject in the Subject page of NLLDS, and you can also click it to view the detail page; if the subject has not submit the survey or the access code was assigned incorrectly, it will display Not Found . Please publish the survey after it is fully designed and tested. Do not stop the survey easily after it has published, otherwise all survey data will be archived in the history table and feedback cannot be viewed in real time. FTPServer The FTPServer navigation in the sidebar is only visible to administrators. When click it you will jump to the root path of file system, which means you can view and manage all project files in our system. If you are not an administrator, you do not have this permission. You can only access each subject directory individually in the Subject page. In Subject page, clicking the link under TaskFile field will jump to the Behavior directory of this subject, where you can upload Behavior data here. And click the view button under NeuroFile will jump to the Neuroimaging directory of this subject, where you can upload Neuroimaging file here. Here are some features of our file system: Toolbar : Including some main features like New folder , New file , Upload files , Download , Delete , Preview , etc. Columns : Shows some important information about the file and supports sorting. Context menu : Some of these are similar to the toolbar functionality, with additional support for the Rename , Copy , Cut , Edit , Archive , etc. Info : show some file overview information. Please know that we support drag and drop uploading of files, and please do not close the current page while uploading files until the upload is successful. Please be careful when making any deletion operations. We will prompt you with a second confirmation. Important Notice The process of uploading files may be slow due to our server has I/O and network bandwidth limitations, please be patient. For large files, upload one by one will be better. It is not recommended to open multiple windows for uploading as it may occupy other people's network bandwidth. File uploads and downloads may need to comply with cross-boundary data flow agreements. Please do not upload any sensitive information. This system is for internal use only, please do not disclose any website information or personal accounts to non-affiliated parties. Any errors or problems found please contact the administrator (yiduwu@cuhk.edu.hk) for assistance.
