Author: Wu Yidu Last updated on April 17, 2024 by Yidu Overview The NLLDS was built for the data collection and organization for Prof. Feng Gangyi's research group. The NLLDS is used for project management, experiment data collection and storage, and questionnaire management. It can be accessed from the public network. Here are some quick facts for your reference. Web Address : http://137.189.158.12/NLLDS/login Administrators : Feng Gangyi (g.feng@cuhk.edu.hk) ; Wu Yidu (yiduwu@cuhk.edu.hk) Web Interface In this section, I will introduce some useful features in our website. Login When you access the web address by your browser (recommand chrome, edge, firefox), you will be directed to the login page. Type your username and password (distributed by administrators), and click Login button to login. Project If successful you will see the project page. You will see your projects here (Only if the project is managed by you or you are one of the collaborators), you cannot view other projects which are not relevant to you. The Add Project button is only visible to administrators, which means you are not authorized to create projects. When creating a project, administrators need to fill in the project name, project description (not necessary), and assign managers and collaborators. Here are descriptions of these fields: Project_ID : Mark the uniqueness of the project. (automatically generated by the system) Project_Name : Filled by administrators, supports clicking to jump to the subpage. Survey_ID : Associated with the survey system automatically, supports clicking to jump to the survey page. Will be mentioned again later. Descriptions : Filled by administrators. Manage_By : Specified by administrators. Collaborator : Specified by administrators. Created_By : Record who created the project. Created_date : Project create date. Subject If you click the project name or double-click this project item, you will jump to the subpage which lists all the subject information of this project. Click Add Subject button then you can add subjects for this project. The system will automatically generate the latest Subject No. in a specific format. Although we allow modifications, in most cases please use the system-generated Subject No. directly! Please note that Subject No. does not allow duplicates. Here are descriptions of these fields: Subject_No : Automatically generated by system. Survey : Associated with the survey system automatically, supports clicking to jump to the survey answer page. Will be mentioned again later. TaskFile : Lists all the tasks of this project and supports clicking to jump to the file system to view this subject's task data. Each task corresponds to a Behavior file. Will be mentioned again later. NeuroFile : Supports clicking to jump to the file system to view this subject's Neuroimaging data. Task Click on the Task navigation in the sidebar, then you will come to this page to Add Task for each projects. The tasks lists here will be the tasks for all the projects that are relevant to you. And you can only add tasks for these projects, with support for deletion. After added, you'll see the TaskFile synchronization updated in the Subject page. Here are descriptions of these fields: Project_ID : Associated with project. Task_Name : Filled by you. Task_Descriptions : Filled by you. Created_By : Record who created the task. Created_date : Task create date. Survey Click on the Survey navigation in the sidebar, then you will come to the Survey System, which was modified and deployed by the open source project LimeSurvey . So you can refer to the official documentation (https://manual.limesurvey.org/LimeSurvey_Manual) for detailed instructions on using this system. You don't need to pay much attention to configuration-related content, as I've already set it up for our usage scenarios, but rather just focus on the questionnaire design and publishing module. Compared to googleform, it supports more comprehensive questionnaire forms and features, and the data can be localized. I will make some special instructions below. Since the Survey system is independent, you will also need to perform a login operation, with the same account password as you used to log into the NLLDS system. After successful login, you will come to the main interface, which contains navigation of some main functions, focusing on Create survey and List surveys pages. In List surveys page, you can view and manage all surveys here. Remember Survey ID ? We show it on the Project page, and it's the ID that allows the project to be associated with the survey. So how we can associate them? We need to set up the Survey alias same as our project name and then our system will automatically associate with it. If something wrong, the Survey_ID shows in the Project page will display Not Found . Once everything done, you can find the Survey URL here, also you can click the Survey_ID shows in the Project page, which use the same link. We'd better switch the Survey to closed-access mode, i.e., Survey participants need to get a pre-assigned access code to access the Survey, and we can assign SubjectNo to each participant as their access code. Fill in the SubjectNo assigned to each participant here. After that, each participant will need to fill in the access code ( SubjectNo ) to access their Survey. After the survey participant fills in the correct access code and submits their survey, you can view the survey content of each subject in the Subject page of NLLDS, and you can also click it to view the detail page; if the subject has not submit the survey or the access code was assigned incorrectly, it will display Not Found . Please publish the survey after it is fully designed and tested. Do not stop the survey easily after it has published, otherwise all survey data will be archived in the history table and feedback cannot be viewed in real time. FTPServer The FTPServer navigation in the sidebar is only visible to administrators. When click it you will jump to the root path of file system, which means you can view and manage all project files in our system. If you are not an administrator, you do not have this permission. You can only access each subject directory individually in the Subject page. In Subject page, clicking the link under TaskFile field will jump to the Behavior directory of this subject, where you can upload Behavior data here. And click the view button under NeuroFile will jump to the Neuroimaging directory of this subject, where you can upload Neuroimaging file here. Here are some features of our file system: Toolbar : Including some main features like New folder , New file , Upload files , Download , Delete , Preview , etc. Columns : Shows some important information about the file and supports sorting. Context menu : Some of these are similar to the toolbar functionality, with additional support for the Rename , Copy , Cut , Edit , Archive , etc. Info : show some file overview information. Please know that we support drag and drop uploading of files, and please do not close the current page while uploading files until the upload is successful. Please be careful when making any deletion operations. We will prompt you with a second confirmation. Important Notice The process of uploading files may be slow due to our server has I/O and network bandwidth limitations, please be patient. It is not recommended to open multiple windows for uploading as it may occupy other people's network bandwidth. File uploads and downloads may need to comply with cross-boundary data flow agreements. Please do not upload any sensitive information. This system is for internal use only, please do not disclose any website information or personal accounts to non-affiliated parties. Any errors or problems found please contact the administrator (yiduwu@cuhk.edu.hk) for assistance.

If you are using the cluster for the first time, you should read this page carefully. Get Your Account Before you use the cluster, you should apply an account from our administrators. Please send an email to Yidu Wu ( yiduwu@cuhk.edu.hk ) with your name , position , and expected study years (for students) . If you are new to Linux Unfortunately, our cluster is running Linux operating system. If you have never used Linux before, it may be pretty uncomfortable for you to use a new operating system by command line but not GUI. We understand your feeling, but please try to get familiar with Linux commands on a virtual machine before moving on. The following document assumes you have experience with Linux. For Windows Users To access a Linux server on Windows, you need to install software through SSH and SFTP . You can try out the following software. SSH Client: MobaXterm , XShell (Recommand) SFTP Client: MobaXterm , Xftp (Recommand) , FileZilla For Linux/MaxOS Users The cluster can log through SSH . On Linux or macOS terminal, input the following command to login. $ ssh <username>@<ip> -p <port> After a successful connection, the server will prompt you to enter a password. Please enter the password which you got from administrators at this time. There will be no response on the interface when you enter the password, but the password has already been entered. Change your password at your first login An initial password was sent to each user for their first-time-login. For security reason, please change your password with: $ passwd Package Installation Please note that for security reasons, all users do not have sudo permissions by default. It means that you cannot install the required packages by raising to root privileges with the sudo command! Nevertheless, you can still install the packages you need by the way of compiling the source code, although this will take some effort and requires some expertise in linux. Alternatively, you can contact the administrator to install the packages for you. Run your Programme on our Compute Nodes Since we only have 1 GPU right now, we are holding off on using e.g. SLURM resource management software to manage our cluster. Instead of it, at this stage we consider a negotiated allocation to use our compute nodes. An easy way to do this is to book it directly in the DingTalk calendar! Before using the cluster you should organize your schedule ahead of time and add it to our DingTalk calendar, making sure not to cross over with other people's schedules. Please use computing nodes strictly according to the calendar schedule. If there are indeed urgent tasks that need to be prioritized, please negotiate with the user who owns the current schedule. Check the resources Before running the program, check the GPU to ensure there are sufficient computing resources, input the following command. $ nvidia-smi And it will output: +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | NVIDIA-SMI 535.171.04 Driver Version: 535.171.04 CUDA Version: 12.2 | |-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | GPU Name Persistence-M | Bus-Id Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

You can also see all processes that are taking up memory, and if you make sure that a process doesn't need to run anymore, you can kill it to free up memory. But be careful not to kill programs that other users may be running! Conda First thing first, whenever you create a new python project, the most important step is setting up the python interpreter. Using the python interpreter of your virtual enviornment is recommended, which can separate the develop enviroments for each of your project. Conda is officially recommended by PyTorch and TensorFlow. Here\u2019s some conda command: # create conda env with python (you can specify python version) conda create --name <new-env-name> python=3.8 # check envs conda env list # activate env conda activate <env-name> # deactivate env conda deactivate # install package like pandas conda install pandas Tumx If you only use ssh to connect to the server to run the program, the program will be shut down as soon as ssh breaks (Even if you don't end it manually, ssh will often break unexpectedly due to network problems). The solution is to use tmux to open a session and run it in the background, even if ssh breaks, tmux server will still keep that session for you, so the program will always run in the background. Start a background terminal session using tmux .Simply run tmux , you can get a new session. After run the job, press Ctrl+B D shortcut to detach the session. When you return, use tmux ls to see the session ID, then use tmux a -t <ID> to attach the session and continue the job.
